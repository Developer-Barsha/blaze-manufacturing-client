        "question": "How does prototypical inheritance work?",
        "answer": "Prototypal inheritance is a JavaScript feature used to add methods and properties to objects. In prototypal inheritance, developers define properties inside the function and attach methods to the prototype of the function. And lastly, when they initialize instances of that function, the methods don't get recreated along with other objects."

    {
        "question": "Why you do not set the state directly in React?",
        "answer": "We should never set a state directly. Because if we do we won't be able to modify it the way we would be. If you set it directly, calling setProducts()  later to update, may not replace the update you made. This will cause us to lose control of that state."
    },

        "question": "What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?",
